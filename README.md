Project Description:

In this project, I performed a comprehensive analysis of bike sales data, focusing on data cleaning, transformation, and visualization. The dataset contained extensive information on bike purchases, including customer demographics and purchase details.

Key steps involved:

Data Cleaning: Ensured data accuracy by identifying and correcting errors, handling missing values, and standardizing formats.

Pivot Table Creation: Developed a pivot table to summarize and analyze data, enabling detailed insights into sales trends, customer preferences, and demographic breakdowns.

Dashboard Development: Created an interactive dashboard that visualizes key metrics and trends using charts and graphs. This dashboard provides a clear, at-a-glance view of sales performance, aiding in strategic decision-making.

Tools Used: Microsoft Excel (for data cleaning, pivot table creation, and dashboard development).

This project demonstrates my ability to manage and analyze large datasets, draw actionable insights, and present them in a visually appealing and easy-to-understand format.
